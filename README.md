# Vignettes Mash-Up Mod Pack
Mod jam pack for the [March 2024 Caves of Qud Mod Jam: Vignettes](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2). See all the entries [here](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2/entries)!

A gigantic reinforced flexiweaved thanks to everyone who participated! — The mod jam organizers

Press `ctrl-shift-W` (can be re-bound under `Key Mapping > Debug > Mod Jam Wish Menu`) or wish for `modjampack` to open a menu for easy wishing for the pack's contents (thanks gnarf!).

**A note on balance**: this pack is intended to let one sample from the various things added by all of the mods and will likely result a mildly chaotic Caves of Qud run. Each of these mods is available individually at the submissions page linked above, should you wish for a more curated experience.

This version of the pack is for the 206.X version of Caves of Qud.

**Warning**: Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.
