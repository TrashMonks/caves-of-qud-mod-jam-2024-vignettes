# Vignettes Mash-Up Mod Pack
Mod jam pack for the March 2024 [Caves of Qud Mod Jam: Vignettes](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2). See all the entries [here](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2/entries)!

A gigantic reinforced flexiweaved thanks to everyone who participated! â€” The mod jam organizers

While playing, use the in-game wish menu for easy access to the pack's contents (Debug > Wish Menu, bound to <kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>W</kbd> by default) or by wishing `vignetteswishmenu` (this can be bound to its own key under Debug > Vignettes Mash-Up Wish Menu).

**A note on balance**: this pack is intended to let one sample from the various things added by all of the mods and will likely result a mildly chaotic Caves of Qud run. Each of these mods is available individually at the submissions page linked above, should you wish for a more curated experience.

This version of the pack is for the 1.0.4 release (build 210.X) of Caves of Qud.

**Warning**: Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.
