  "Description": "[quote]You trip on a cord in time's silly carpet, and right yourself with a tenuous grasp on the constellation that your presence has formed with an earlier one. Surroundings collapse and crystallize. As you snatch up the shiny bits, they project tales into thoughtspace. What happened here?[/quote]\n\nCompilation mod pack for the [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2]Caves of Qud Modding Jam: Vignettes[/url], which ran in March 2024. See all of the entries [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2/entries]here[/url]!\n\nA gigantic lanterned scaled thanks to all who participated!\nâ€” The mod jam organizers\n\nWhile playing, use the in-game wish menu for easy access to the pack's contents (Debug > Wish Menu, bound to shift-W by default) or by wishing 'vignetteswishmenu' (this can be bound to its own key).\n\n[b]A note on balance:[/b] this pack is intended to let one sample from the various things added by all of the mods and will likely result a slightly chaotic Caves of Qud run. Each of these mods is available individually at the submissions page linked above, should you wish for a more curated experience.\n\nThis version of the pack is for the 1.0.4 release (build 210.X) of Caves of Qud.\n\n[b]Warning:[/b] Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.\n\n[url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2]Mod jam page (itch)[/url] | [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-2/entries]Mod jam entries (itch)[/url] | [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3199902804]Submissions collection (Steam)[/url] | [url=https://github.com/TrashMonks/caves-of-qud-mod-jam-2024-vignettes]Source Code (GitHub)[/url]\n\n[quote]Lost!
